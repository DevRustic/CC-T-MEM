# What is this?

This is a monitoring tool for ME Systems for 1.18.2. It monitors a large amount (configurable in the code) of ME Systems and their availability, and storage capacity.

It also includes resourceMonitor.lua which is a monitor for certain resource types (also configurable), and notes how many you have on a monitor.
